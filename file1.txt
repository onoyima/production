# Requirements Document


## Introduction


The Veritas University Exeat System is a comprehensive digital platform designed to replace the traditional paper-based exeat application process. The system enables students to apply for permission to leave campus, facilitates multi-level approval workflows, ensures parental consent verification, and provides real-time tracking and monitoring capabilities. The frontend will serve seven distinct user roles with tailored interfaces and permissions, ensuring accountability, preventing protocol bypassing, and maintaining proper documentation throughout the entire exeat lifecycle.
